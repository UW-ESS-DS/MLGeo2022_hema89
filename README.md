## Project interests

I'm interested in land classification models particularly forest plantation detection. I'm also interested in identifying the type of tree species growing in a particular plantation. With that research interest, my favorite earth science topics include using machine learning to perform
1. Forest land feature extraction
2. Finding the within-species spectral similarity and between-species spectral dissimilarity
